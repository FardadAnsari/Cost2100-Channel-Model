# Cost2100-Channel-Model
This repo provides MATLAB implementations of the COST2100 channel model for realistic MIMO simulations. It generates channel state information (CSI) in domains such as spatial–delay and angular–delay, supports dataset creation for deep learning, and includes demo scripts for visualization and analysis in wireless communication research.
